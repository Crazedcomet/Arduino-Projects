Hello, this project uses 100% Arduino code and hardware. 
You can use the project to help you find alternative sources to light up your room. For example, where the green wire is, you can place any conductive material and it will light up the led light!
You can also add more leds to create a bigger lamp or a night light to help you out!
Enjoy!
